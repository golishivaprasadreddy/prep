1. Define earthquake and explain in detail about the types, causes and preventative measures of earthquake.
(10 Marks – Well-structured, student-friendly)

Introduction  
An earthquake is a sudden shaking or vibration of the Earth’s surface caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the crust. The energy stored in rocks gets released in the form of seismic waves, which cause ground shaking and destruction. Earthquakes vary in magnitude, duration, and impact depending on their origin.

**Types of Earthquakes**

1. **Tectonic Earthquakes**  
   - Occur due to the movement of tectonic plates.  
   - Most common and destructive type.

2. **Volcanic Earthquakes**  
   - Triggered by volcanic activity and movement of magma beneath the earth’s crust.  
   - Usually localized near volcanoes.

3. **Collapse Earthquakes**  
   - Small earthquakes caused by collapse of underground mines or caverns.  
   - Localized and less damaging.

4. **Explosive (Human-Induced) Earthquakes**  
   - Caused by nuclear tests, blasting, or reservoir-induced seismicity.  
   - Artificial in origin.

---

**Causes of Earthquakes**

- **Plate Tectonics:** Colliding, sliding, or diverging tectonic plates generate stress resulting in fault rupture.
- **Volcanic Activity:** Movement of lava and gas pressure beneath volcanoes triggers seismic activity.
- **Faulting in the Earth’s Crust:** Sudden displacement of rocks along geological faults (e.g., San Andreas Fault).
- **Human Activities:** Mining, dam construction, oil drilling, and nuclear explosions disturb underground stability.
- **Isostatic Adjustments:** Natural balancing movements of the Earth's crust following melting of glaciers or erosion.

---

**Preventive Measures for Earthquakes**

- **Earthquake-Resistant Construction:** Use flexible building materials, shock absorbers, and base isolation systems.
- **Retrofitting Old Buildings:** Strengthen existing structures with steel frames and reinforcement.
- **Land-Use Planning:** Avoid constructing buildings near fault lines or unstable areas.
- **Early Warning Systems:** Seismic sensors, alarms, and satellite monitoring help detect early signs and reduce loss.
- **Public Awareness & Preparedness:** Training, earthquake drills, emergency kits, and evacuation procedures help reduce casualties.

Conclusion  
Earthquakes are natural phenomena that cannot be prevented but their impacts can be minimized through proper planning, engineering solutions, monitoring systems, and community awareness.

12. A. Write a note on floods and discuss its types and causes.
(7 Marks)

Introduction  
A flood is an overflow of water onto normally dry land, caused by excessive rainfall, river overflow, dam break, or storm surges. Floods can lead to large-scale loss of life, property damage, soil erosion, and disruption of transportation and communication systems.

**Types of Floods**

1. **River or Fluvial Floods**  
   - Occur when river water exceeds capacity and spills over banks.

2. **Flash Floods**  
   - Sudden floods caused by intense rainfall, dam break, or cloud bursts.  
   - Highly dangerous due to rapid onset.

3. **Coastal Floods**  
   - Triggered by cyclones, tsunamis, or storm surges near coastal areas.

4. **Urban Floods**  
   - Happens when drainage systems fail due to heavy rainfall or poor planning in cities.

5. **Pluvial (Surface Water) Floods**  
   - Caused by rainfall accumulation where water cannot infiltrate the soil.

---

**Causes of Floods**

- Heavy and continuous rainfall
- Cyclones, hurricanes, and storm surges
- River overflow due to snowmelt or excessive runoff
- Dam failure or improper reservoir management
- Deforestation, urbanization, and poor drainage systems
- Blockage of river channels due to siltation or landslides

Conclusion  
Floods are common disasters that occur due to both natural and human-induced factors. Proper management and planning can significantly reduce their impact.

- Cyclones
- Blocked drainage systems
- Rapid snowmelt

Effects:
- Loss of life and infrastructure
- Soil erosion and water contamination

---

c) Tsunami  
A tsunami is a series of large ocean waves caused mainly by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. When these waves reach shallow coastal areas, their height increases dramatically, leading to massive destruction.
